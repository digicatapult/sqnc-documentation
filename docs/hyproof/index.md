# HyProof

## HyProof: Overview

**HyProof**, aka **Hydrogen Proof** is the codename for our new **HII Seed** blockchain project. _HII Seed_ aims to push the boundaries when it comes to building and researching the socio-technical acceptability and business implications of a fully digitised UK certification infrastructure for verifiable hydrogen provenance ( green hydrogen to be more exact ), and develop an MVP-grade demonstration of the same.

As verifiable hydrogen provenance seems to be the key focus nowadays and as this seems to be a major business driver for UK exports and domestic usage, this blockchain is trying to do exactly that.

This is the opportune moment for HII-SEED to shine a light on this alternate, more trustworthy, more performant, lower cost future to
enable the UK hydrogen ecosystem.

For this proof of concept it has been decided that the consensus layer will be constructed using our in-house build **[DSCP](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-documentation)** ( **D**istributed-**S**upply-**C**hain-**P**latform ). However, this layer will not include the vanilla default version of DSCP but a special flavor of this platform that uses a purposely-build custom process flow.

## HyProof: Process Flows

The token model or better said, the the definition of the two token types plus flow restriction functions for this project can be found with proper explanations in the **[token-flows.md](./token-flows.md)** document.

The token model is also available in our Domain Specific Language ( .DSCP ) and can be found in **`dscp-hyproof-api`** repository, more exactly in **[processFlows.dscp](https://github.com/digicatapult/dscp-hyproof-api/blob/main/processFlows.dscp)**.
