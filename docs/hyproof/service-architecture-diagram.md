# HyProof Service Architecture Diagram

The following represents a diagram containing all the services needed to spin up this project ( basically everything needed can be found in the **`sqnc-hyproof-api`** repository ). To spin-up a sqnc blockchain network directly without having the client in docker, please clone the **`sqnc-node`** repository.
