# HyProof Service Architecture Diagram

The following represents a diagram containing all the services needed to spin up this project ( basically everything needed can be found in the **`dscp-hyproof-api`** repository ). To spin-up a dscp blockchain network directly without having the client in docker, please clone the **`dscp-node`** repository.
