# Logistics Living Lab (L3)

The [Logistics Living Lab](https://digitalsupplychainhub.uk/showcase/logistics-living-lab/) is one of the flagship projects of the Made Smarter Innovation | Digital Supply Chain Hub.

L3 will demonstrate the value of creating a shared public infrastructure for managing delivery vehicle slot filling, routing, and tracking. This will enable logistics companies to collaborate where necessary, and still compete in new and more efficient ways, while enhancing UK manufacturing capability.

Part of the shared infrastructure is built using `DSCP`.
